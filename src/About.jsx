                    This is a tool for identifying perfect trio boost node pairs or groups in Maplestory.

                    The V-Matrix is unlocked after completing the 5th job allowing you open nodestones for nodes
                    that give new skills or nodes which boosts the damage of previously existing skills.

                <h3>Why does this exist?</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    The effects from boost nodes are a significant portion of your damage, so it is important to get as much as you can from them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there are a few restrictions that make maximizing boost node gains difficult:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unless you're higher leveled, you are limited on node slots.</li>
                    <li>Skills boosted by nodes are randomized when opening nodestones.</li>
                    <li>A node can have a max level of 25, but a total boost to a skill can be stacked up to 50 (60 if you count node slot upgrades).</li>
                    <li>You can only equip 1 boost node per left-most skill (i.e. A node that has skills A, B, C shares a left-most skill with a node that has skills A, D, E and therefore cannot be equipped together)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We get around these restrictions by equipping multiple unique boost nodes and making sure each skill gets a total boost of 50 as a result.</p>
                <p>The main challenge is finding a grouping of boost nodes that can actually accomplish this and do so efficiently.</p>
                <p>That's where this tool comes in. You insert all your boost nodes, chooses which skills you need and it will identify all (given enough time) node grouping options letting you pick and choose which one to use.</p>
